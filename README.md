## Introduction

During my internship at Hackveda Limited, I had the opportunity to work on various data science and machine learning projects. These projects involved tasks such as data pre-processing, model training, performance evaluation, and deployment. The following sections provide an overview of each project, including the methodologies used and key findings.

## Future Location Prediction
### Description
Dataset: Location data

Tasks:
* Uploaded the location dataset to Dataiku DSS
* Pre-processed the dataset and split it into training and testing subsets (80/20 ratio)
* Trained models using Lasso Regression and XGBoost
* Evaluated model performance and applied the model to predict longitude coordinates
* Created a presentation explaining the model training, implementation, and recommendations

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
### Description
Tasks:
* Set up the environment and loaded data
* Explored and visualized data using pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn
* Conducted data pre-processing and analysis, focusing on patterns, trends, and anomalies
* Documented analysis steps and key findings in a report format
* Created visualizations to support conclusions and compiled a final report

## Predictive Modeling
### Description
Tasks:
* Pre-processed and split the data
* Built models using Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and Random Forests
* Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score
* Conducted feature selection using techniques like feature importance from Decision Trees or Random Forests
* Summarized findings and insights in the Jupyter notebook

## Prescriptive Analytics
### Description
Tasks:
* Defined problem statement and deliverables
* Explored and pre-processed data for demand patterns, seasonality, and trends
* Implemented optimization algorithms for inventory management
* Conducted sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of parameter changes
* Documented key insights and completed the final report and submission package

## Historical Stock Market Data Analysis
### Description
Tasks:
* Collected historical stock market data from Alpha Vantage API
* Pre-processed data to handle missing data points and ensure consistency
* Conducted exploratory data analysis to identify patterns and trends
* Saved pre-processed data for further analysis and documented the entire process

## Trend Line Plotting
### Description
Tasks:
* Acquired and prepared data
* Handled missing values and data inconsistencies
* Created time series plots and identified/drew trend lines
* Annotated charts and prepared a professional presentation

Files:
trend_line_plotting.ipynb

## Technical Analysis
### Description
Tasks:
* Prepared and loaded data
* Identified support and resistance levels and drew trendlines
* Plotted different types of charts and discussed their significance
* Documented analysis and created a comprehensive report and presentation
